# Navigation
For the most part, any given Basic Page or Webform is responsible for whether
and where it shows up in the sites navigation. When you [Add
content](http://antiochcollege.org/node/add) or edit existing content,
there is a section on the bottom of the page marked "Menu settings" if
you are able to adjust this setting.

## Not all content gets a menu
Types of content that tend to show up in large lists like events or blog
posts do not need to be assigned menu settings. Drupal is smarte enough
to create the navigation for these types for you.
