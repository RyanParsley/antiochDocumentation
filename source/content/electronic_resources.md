# Electronic Resources

The [Electronic Resources](http://antiochcollege.org/about/electronic-resources) section is a currated collection of PDFs. Some are private, some are more public. At the time of writing this documentation, this section is focused around Self-Study documents.

## Create a new Electronic Resource

Resources are created, like most content in the system, via the "[Add content](http://antiochcollege.org/node/add/electronic-resource)" link at the top left corner of the screen. 

## Permissions

By default, only administrators and users with the role "media" can view documents. On a per document basis you can designate what roles can and can not view an Electronic Resource. Administrators always have access to Electronic Resources.

### Anonymous users

At the time this document was written, no resources were accessible to anonymous (not logged in) users. As such, the whole section is hidden from them in the menu. You need to be logged in to view the electronic resource section.

## The Electronic Resources vocabulary

Adding terms to the "[Electronic Resources](http://antiochcollege.org/admin/structure/taxonomy/electronic_resources)" vocabulary enables us to sort them on various pages. For instance there is a "Criterion" term that has various terms beneth it (Criterion One, Criterion Two...). This is how the site knows which pages to show on the "[Criterion](http://antiochcollege.org/about/electronic-resources/criterion)" subsection.
