# Creating content is easy
To minimize your need to understand the minutia of making webpages, I've
created a modular system full of sensible defaults. Here is a reference
to the kinds of content you may wish to create and how they differ.

## Slides for the Slideshow
### Internal pages
Most slides that will be featured on the home page will link to pages on
[antiochcollege.org](http://antiochcollege.org). All you need to do to
create the slide is edit the page to which it links. At the bottom of
the edit page, there is a "Slideshow Content" region. In this section,
fill in the Slide Title, Slide Message. If you want to create a slide,
but not display it until later, simply leave "Display this slide"
unchecked.

### External pages
If you wish to create a slide that links to a page on some other site, [Add content](http://antiochcollege.org/node/add)
of type ["External slide"](http://antiochcollege.org/node/add/external-slide)
