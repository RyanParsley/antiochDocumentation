# Create a new course offering
## Notes for faculty
You'll need to be [logged in](http://antiochcollege.org/user) with an account that has been flagged as a faculty member. This should already be set up, but if you don't see some of the following links, confirm that you are listed on [the faculty page](http://antiochcollege.org/academics/faculty).

Start out by clicking "Add content" in the gray bar at the top of the screen. On the next page select, "Course Offering". Fill out the form and a draft of the course will be created. Once this draft is approved by an admin, it will show up on on the appropriate course list based on the term that you filled out (eg [Summer 2013](http://antiochcollege.org/academics/courses)).

Note that you don't need to enter Credits, Course Description or Course ID because that information will all be loaded automatically when you enter the appropriate "Course Title" (eg "Cultural Anthropology")

## Notes for administrators

To approve a "Course Offering" draft, visit the "Find content" link at the top of the page. You can filter the results in the box labeled "SHOW ONLY ITEMS WHERE". Select a status of "not published" and type "Course Offering" then click the "Filter button.

Once you've located the appropriate "Course Offering", select the "edit" link towards the right of the table. At the bottom of that page there is a menu with a "Publishing options" link. This link will reveal a section where you can change the "Moderation state" to "Published". This will enable the "Course Offering" to be seen on the appropriate course list based on "Course Term".
