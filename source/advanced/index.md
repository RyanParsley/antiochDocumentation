# Beyond the basics
Here is a little more information for the curious. You don't need to
read this to use the CMS, but these things may help you enjoy the
process a little more.

## Markdown is simpler than markup
Even if you know html fairly well, it's pretty verbose and cumbersome to
type. Markdown is a simple, terse, way of formatting plain text so that
the CMS can create all of the html stuff for you. You don't have to use
it. But I think you'll like it. It's how I do most of my web writing
(including this documentation). You can read more about [how markdown
works](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) as it's
documented by the guy who invented it. 

## What the heck is this Drupal thing!?

[AntiochCollege.org](http://antiochcollege.org) was built on a platform
called [Drupal](http://drupal.org/). You may have heard of it referred
to as a Content Management System (or CMS). Basically it's piece of software that handles a lot of the
heavy lifting of making complicated websites, so all you have to do is
type in the write box and everything just works.
