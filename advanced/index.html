        <p>Here is a little more information for the curious. You don't need to
        read this to use the CMS, but these things may help you enjoy the
        process a little more.</p>
        
        <h2 id="markdown-is-simpler-than-markup">Markdown is simpler than markup</h2>
        <p>Even if you know html fairly well, it's pretty verbose and cumbersome to
        type. Markdown is a simple, terse, way of formatting plain text so that
        the CMS can create all of the html stuff for you. You don't have to use
        it. But I think you'll like it. It's how I do most of my web writing
        (including this documentation). You can read more about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">how markdown
        works</a> as it's
        documented by the guy who invented it. </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Drupal is an open source content management platform powering
        millions of websites and applications. It’s built, used, and supported
        by an active and diverse community of people around the world."
        —<a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal.org</a>
        <a href="http://antiochcollege.org">AntiochCollege.org</a> was built on a platform
        called <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. You may have heard of it referred
        to as a Content Management System (or CMS). Basically it's piece of software that handles a lot of the
        heavy lifting of making complicated websites, so all you have to do is
        type in the write box and everything just works. </p>
