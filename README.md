# Documentation Created for Antioch College

This documentation is powered by Middleman with style help from ZURB
Foundation. It's purpose is to document the customized Drupal site that
I developed for [Antioch College](http://antiochcollege.org).

## Middleman Template: ZURB Foundation 

Middleman-Foundation is a [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with the [Compass](http://compass-style.org) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) version of the [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) using [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/). As with all Middleman templates, using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [RVM](https://rvm.io/) is recommended.
